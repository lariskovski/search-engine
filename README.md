# Search Engine

The project gets on how search engines work by building on from scratch in learning Python while having fun.
Based on [Udacity Intro to Computer Science](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101) course.

## Course Main Topics

    - Variables
    - Basic Operations and Conditionals
    - Defining functions and Python built-in functions
    - Strings, Lists, Dictionaries
    - Creating Hashtables
    - For loops, While loops
    - Time Complexity on lists vs hashtables and improving performance
    - How to implement Recursion
    - Fibonacci and Palindromes with and without recursion
    - What are Graphs and how to use them in Python
    - Ranking pages algorithms and a (not so) simple implementation
    - Searching through hashtables and ranks for the better results

### Few Extras:

    - timer Decorator
    - Stripping HTML from string

## The Search Engine

As this project does not aim to be a full-blown Google-like engine, it uses a controlled environment with two main seeds provided by the course intructors. Each seed is better for a certain feature example.

- https://udacity.github.io/cs101x/urank/: Few linked web pages and few keywords about recepies
- https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1661/pg1661.txt: A book page with +1500 keywords and not links

The first one makes very clear how the engine's crawler goes from one page to another.
While the second is better at showing how the engine indexes new keywords.
Both are pretty good exemplifing the searches.
